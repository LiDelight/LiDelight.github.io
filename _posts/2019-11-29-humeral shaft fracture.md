### What will happen if there is a humeral midshaft fracture?
   1. There are two cases: 
   - In closed fracture, radial injury is most commonly an incomplete neuropraxia rather than a complete laceration of the nerve. And radial injury occurs in nearly 18%.
   - In open fracture, the incidence of radial nerve laceration is much higher at 60%.

### The structure and function of radial nerve
   1. A brife introduction of radial nerve
   - origin: from plexus and has nerve roots from C5-T1
   - course: Exists **axillary fossa posterior** to axillary artery, passes posterior to humerus in **radial groove** with **profunda branchii artery** *between lateral and medial heads of triceps*; perforates **lateral intermuscular spetum**; enters **cubital fossa**. dividing into superficial and deep branch
   - Innervaterd: All muscles of posterior compartments of arm and forarm; skin of posterior and inferolateral arm. posterior forarm, and dorsum of hand lateral to axial line of digit 4 ![structure_of_radial_nerve](https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/006W8mGzgy1g9ewzd3t9vj30dw0e5q6m.jpg)
   - ![anatomy](https://wx1.sinaimg.cn/mw690/006W8mGzly1g9exaubl8bj30e60hzk1f.jpg)
   - The large muscles that surround the humerus prevent direct palpation. The arm is divided into anterior and posterior compartments by two intermuscular septa: medial and lateral. [6] The anterior compartment contains the following:
     - Biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and brachialis
     - Brachial artery and vein
     - Median, musculocutaneous, and ulnar nerves
    The posterior compartment contains the following:
     - Triceps
     - Radial nerve


### What happens?
   - Kind of fracture:There are some fractures maybe in the humerus: surgical neck-->axillary nerve; radial groove--> radial nerve; medial epicondyle-->ulnar nerve; besides, median nerve in the medial of fossa maybe fracture too.![fracture](https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/006W8mGzgy1g9exmt49bxj30ab0ba776.jpg)
   - Sympose: The radial nerve is most likely to be damaged in humerus fractures that have a lateral displacement of the distal fracture segment, as the **nerve is tethered to the bone** and cannot withstand the forces applied to it as a result of the displacement. On physical exam, patients with a radial nerve injury may have **wrist drop** (loss or weakness of wrist extensors), loss or weakness of finger extension, and decreased or absent sensation to the posterior forearm, digits 1 to 3, and the radial half of the fourth digit. Up to 90% of patients with a closed humeral fracture with radial nerve injury will have a resolution of *neuropraxia* within three to four months following the injury.
